                Playing the guitar has been a hobby of mine for most of my life. To play, two things are essential: <span class="bold"> a guitar, and chords</span>.
              </p>
              <p>
                <span class="bold">Ultimate Guitar</span> is a website that provides thousands of tabs so that anyone can play along. You can find charts of the most popular songs -by views- of the day and of all time.
              </p>
              <p>
                I always considered my taste in music quite unique. I don't listen to the most popular artists, and most of my friends don't even know my favorite artists or songs.
                However, I wondered: <span class="bold">which chords do I, subconsciously, like the most?</span> Are they similar to the chords that most people listen to?
              </p>
              <p>
                I decided then to compare the top chords in 50 of my favorite songs to those in Ultimate Guitar's All-time Top 50.
              </p>
              <p class="special-p">

                Let's get down to it. Are the most frequent chords in my favorite songs also frequent in popular songs?

                As it turns out, my favorite chords seem to be quite popular amongst the most played songs too. Does this mean my taste in music is actually biased, 
                and listening to popular songs throughout my life has influenced what I consider my favorite songs? Or does this simply mean most songs have similar chords?

                Notes: All analysis was made based on the 4 most frequent chords in each song, taking into account the first verse, pre-chorus (if available), and chorus.
                If a song had less than 4 chords, only those chords were considered. If more than one chord tied as the 4th most frequent chord, all of those chords were considered.
                My favorite chords were chosen based on my most listened songs in Spotify since 2016. All songs considered in the analysis are in English.
